##
## Strfry Router Config for Noornote (PROXY Mode)
##
## This config enables bidirectional sync with public relays.
## - Events written to local relay are forwarded to public relays
## - Events from public relays are cached locally
##

streams {
  # Public Nostr relays (bidirectional sync)
  public-relays {
    # Direction: "up" (local→remote), "down" (remote→local), "both" (bidirectional)
    dir = "both"

    # Public relay URLs
    # You can add/remove relays as needed
    urls = [
      "wss://relay.damus.io"
      "wss://relay.primal.net"
      "wss://nos.lol"
      "wss://relay.nostr.band"
    ]

    # Optional: Filter which events to sync
    # Uncomment to only sync specific kinds:
    # filter {
    #   kinds = [0, 1, 3, 6, 7]  # Metadata, text notes, contacts, reposts, reactions
    # }

    # Connection settings
    timeout = 30000  # 30 seconds
  }
